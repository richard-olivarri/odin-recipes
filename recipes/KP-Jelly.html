    <p>This krabby patty was one of the most popular amongst the diners of the famous under-sea eatery, and the reason for this is abundantly clear:
         <strong>the jelly!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, like most enjoyable things, there was a trade-off. Many jellyfish appeared to have been left in a life-threatening condition 
        after the harvesting of their jelly. After the harvesting, the seemingly lifeless jellyfish were tossed into the nearest pile of bodies.
         It was pretty bad.
    </p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>ANYWAYS, the krabby patty with jellyfish jelly was definitely one of the best foods to have appeared on the show.</p>
    <p>Here are the ingredients required to make this terrific sandwich:</p>
