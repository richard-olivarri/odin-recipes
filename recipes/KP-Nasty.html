    <h1>THE <em>NAAAASTY</em> PATTY</h1>

    <p>As a fan favorite, this krabby patty earns a place on this list not because of it's desirable flavor/quality, but because of it's impressively
        disgusting design. This, certainly, is the single most repulsive, sickening food item to appear on the show.

    <p>Here is picture of the health inspector before consumption of the nasty patty:</p>

    <p>In conclusion, you DO NOT want to eat a nasty patty</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Here are the required ingredients to be this vomit-inducing concoction, as presented in Season 3 Episode 4a:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Krabby Patty, the ingredients of which can be found <a href="KP.html">here</a></li>
        <li>A dash of volcano sauce</li>
        <li>A spoonful of horseradish sauce</li>
        <li>A jar of Mr. Krabs toenail clippings</li>
        <li>Drop it in the toilet for a few seconds</li>
        <li>Wipe off with Mr. Krabs used gymsocks</li>
    </ul>
